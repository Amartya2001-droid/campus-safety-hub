## Day 1 — campus-safety-hub

Date: Nov 10, 2026. Retroactive report recorded Nov 11 from the merged PRs and existing review evidence.

Did:
- Fixed local login/session cookies, production SPA routing, lint and CI smoke checks: [PR #2](https://github.com/Amartya2001-droid/campus-safety-hub/pull/2), merged.
- Added standing agent instructions and documented actual application/deployment status: [PR #3](https://github.com/Amartya2001-droid/campus-safety-hub/pull/3), merged.
- Reviewed [PR #1](https://github.com/Amartya2001-droid/campus-safety-hub/pull/1#pullrequestreview-5846298150): HOLD, do not merge as-is. It adds a backend and Expo app, has newer dependency fixes available, fails a clean requirements install, uses a known fallback signing key, hardcodes a preview test URL, and collects zero pytest tests.

Blocked on:
- Amartya: decide scope for the proposed backend/app integration and remediate PR #1 blockers before considering it.
- Production configuration, security review, and confirmation of a deployment URL.

Will do tomorrow:
- Create this daily-log file, verify merged main CI and local login/SPA routing, and re-audit PR #1 within the authorized scope.

Live status: not live yet — blocked by unconfirmed deployment URL, production configuration and security review.
